This project will catalog and display my iTunes music library.
It will pull the data either from filesystem or database, previously uploaded
by a perl script, and display on webpage.
</p>
  <br>
<p>
The content frame will present the list of all available genres of the music in
my catalog. Based on user selection the list of songs will be displayed in the
"body" frame, grouped by the album.
